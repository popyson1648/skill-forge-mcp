## Phase 5: Structuring and Completeness Check

**Goal**: Organize research results and verify all categories are covered.

### Completeness Checklist

| Category | Question | Directory |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Theory/Principles | Do we know "what is good"? | `foundations/` |
| Information Requirements | Do we know "what to ask"? | `foundations/` |
| Process | Do we know "how to proceed"? | `foundations/` |
| Patterns/Techniques | Do we know "how to build"? | `implementation/` |
| Anti-patterns | Do we know "what to avoid"? | `implementation/` |
| Verification Methods | Can we verify "was it built correctly"? | `evaluation/` |
| Tech Stack Specific | Does it work with the actual technology? | `frameworks/` |
| Concrete Examples | Are good/bad criteria concrete enough? | `references/` |

Return to Phase 4 to research missing areas until all checks pass.
