## Phase 4: Implementation-Level Deep Research

**Goal**: Fill gaps found in Phase 3 to bring the agent to an actionable level.

| Step | Action | Motivation |
|------|--------|------------|
| 4-1 | Concrete patterns and code examples | Convert theory into implementation |
| 4-2 | Standards and specifications to follow | Quantify and document quality criteria |
| 4-3 | Technical implementation methods | Provide implementation options and when to use each |
| 4-4 | Anti-patterns (what NOT to do) | Knowing "bad" as well as "good" improves judgment |
| 4-5 | Verification methods, tools, self-checks | Enable build → verify → improve cycles |
| 4-6 | Target tech stack specific implementation | Make knowledge practically usable, not theoretical |
| 4-7 | Collect and analyze good/bad examples | Ground output quality criteria in reality |

**Deliverables**: `implementation/`, `evaluation/`, `frameworks/`, `references/`
