## Phase 3: Gap Analysis

**Goal**: Review Phase 2 deliverables and ask "Can the agent actually work with just this?"

Cross-reference with Phase 1 baseline records to verify whether **observed failures are resolved**.

### Evaluation Criteria

| Perspective | Question |
|-------------|----------|
| Theory → Practice | We understand the principles, but how exactly do we implement them? |
| Completeness | Are there important subtopics not covered? |
| Judgment | Can the agent determine "good vs. bad" on its own? |
| Verifiability | Is there a way to confirm the output is correct? |
| Technology Specificity | Does it work with the actual tech stack? |
| Concreteness | Are there concrete examples of good/bad? |

If gaps are found, fill them in Phase 4.
