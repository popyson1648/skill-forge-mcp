## Phase 2: Domain Foundation Research

**Goal**: Define "what counts as good" for the target domain.

Focus research on the failure patterns identified in Phase 1 baseline measurement.

| Step | Action | Question |
|------|--------|----------|
| 2-1 | Research authoritative theories/principles | What are the foundational theories for this domain? |
| 2-2 | Document criteria for "good" | What makes something "good"? |
| 2-3 | Organize information the agent needs | What does the agent need to know to produce good output? |
| 2-4 | Design the workflow the agent should follow | What process should be followed? |

**Deliverable**: `foundations/` — theories, principles, information requirements, processes
